v0.5.1:
- (Bug/Major) Ensurie that the Root device is always part of the generated AMI
- (Bug/Major) Ensure that all volume types are correctly handled (especially 'st1', 'sc1', and 'standard' that were broken)
- (Bug/Minor) Ensure that BlockDeviceMappings are sorted in the same way in instance details (review conversion result window)

v0.5.0:
- (Improvment/Minor) Added more sanity checks about --cpu-options user input.
- (Improvment/Minor) Added --ignore-hibernation-options to not propagate hibernation options if needed by user.
- (Bug/Minor) Do not inherit original instance Spot price when --instance-type is specified but use On-Demand price instead.

- (Bug/Major) Handling of --max-spot-price was broken. Fixed.
- Deprecated v0.4.1 as unuseable.

v0.4.0:
- (Improvment/Minor) Added EC2 Termination protection API sanity check: Do not start a conversion if instance termination protection is set.
- (Improvment/Minor) Added --ignore-userdata to avoid copy of userdata in the converted instance.
- (Improvment/Minor) Ensure that the original instance is in 'terminated' state before to create the converted one.

v0.3.0:
- (Improvment/Major) Added paranoid sanity checks about Spot Requests status. Added the ability to fix 'IncorrectSpotRequestState Exceptions'.
